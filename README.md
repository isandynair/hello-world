# hello-world
Hi Peeps,

I met my colleagues today, ate food at the nearby burger joint.
I have just created my GIT account today and trying to code after a 2 year gap, I know its a long gap so hence decided to learn coding from a MOOC site(Udemy).
Now I am going to relax and watch a football match.
